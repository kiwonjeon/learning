  <p style="marging-top:30px">II. Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership. The traces of the first can be revealed only by chemical or physical analyzes which it is impossible to perform on a reproduction; changes of ownership are subject to a tradition which must be traced from the situation of the original.<br><strong>Walter Benjamin</strong>, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/benjamin.pdf" target="_blank" title="MIT press PDF"><u>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935)</u></a></P>

  <p style="margin-top:30px">“There are no anecdotes in my paintings, nor do I want to tell a story. My paintings are not narrative. What I try to do is to ensnare reality, catch it before it changes into a coherent image. For this reason, the bodies I paint are always in movement. I attempt to express them without falsifying or embellishing the action, without aestheticisms or demythifications. Art is always an artifice; it is not straightforward reality. Artists are necessarily artificial, and they must transform reality into a simple technical artifice. By distorting forms, I arrive at their deeper reality.”<br><strong>Francis Bacon</strong></p>
